# GainNode

The `GainNode` interface represents the change in volume (amplitude) of the audio signal.
It is an [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node) that applies given gain to processing audio data.

Direct gain modification often results in unpleasant 'clicks'. To avoid this effect, utilize exponential interpolation methods from the [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param).

#### [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#properties) properties

#### Envelope - ADSR

Envelope is term widely used in music and sound engineering, it describes how a sound changes over time.
The most common way of describing an envelope is ADSR. This acronym stands for: **attack**, **decay**, **sustain** and **release**.

- **Attack** - the time it takes for the sound to reach its peak volume from the beginning.
- **Decay** - the time it takes for the sound to reach the sustain level after the peak volume.
- **Sustain** - the volume level that the sound will stay at until the key is released.
- **Release** - the time it takes for the sound to fade out after the key is released.

You can read more about envelopes and ADSR on [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)>).

## ADSR Playground

This is an interactive example demonstrating the ADSR on GainNode. You can adjust the parameters in real-time to hear and see how they affect the generated sound wave.

## Constructor

[`BaseAudioContext.createGain()`](/docs/core/base-audio-context#creategain)

## Properties

It inherits all properties from [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#properties).

| Name | Type | Description | |
| :----: | :----: | :-------- | :-: |
| `gain` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`a-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` representing value of gain to apply. | <ReadOnly />

## Methods

`GainNode` does not define any additional methods.
It inherits all methods from [`AudioNode`](/docs/core/audio-node#methods).

## Remarks

#### `gain`
- Default value is 1.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
