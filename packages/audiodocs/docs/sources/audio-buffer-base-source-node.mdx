# AudioBufferBaseSourceNode

The `AudioBufferBaseSourceNode` interface is an [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node) which aggregates behavior of nodes that requires [`AudioBuffer`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer).

Child classes:
 - [`AudioBufferSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-source-node)
 - [`AudioBufferQueueSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-buffer-queue-source-node)

## Properties

It inherits all properties from [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node#properties).

| Name | Type | Description |
| :----: | :----: | :-------- |
| `detune` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` representing detuning of oscillation in cents. |
| `playbackRate` | [`AudioParam`](/docs/core/audio-param) | [`k-rate`](/docs/core/audio-param#a-rate-vs-k-rate) `AudioParam` defining speed factor at which the audio will be played. |

## Methods

`AudioBufferBaseSourceNode` does not define any additional methods.
It inherits all methods from [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](/docs/sources/audio-scheduled-source-node#methods).

## Events

### `onPositionChanged` <MobileOnly />

Allow to set (or remove) callback that will be fired after processing certain part of an audio.
Frequency is defined by `onPositionChangedInterval`. By setting this callback you can achieve pause functionality.
You can remove callback by passing `null`.

### `onPositionChangedInterval` <MobileOnly />

Allow to set frequency for `onPositionChanged` event. Value that can be set is around `1000/x` Hz.

```ts
import { AudioContext, AudioBufferSourceNode } from 'react-native-audio-api';

function App() {
    const ctx = new AudioContext();
    const sourceNode = ctx.createBufferSource();
    sourceNode.buffer = null; //set your buffer
    let offset = 0;

    sourceNode.onPositionChanged = (event) => { //setting callback
        this.offset = event.value;
    };

    sourceNode.onPositionChangedInterval = 100; //setting frequency to ~10Hz

    sourceNode.start();
}
```

## Remarks

#### `detune`
- Default value is 0.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
- For example value of 100 detune the source up by one semitone, whereas -1200 down by one octave.
- When `createBufferSource(true)` it is clamped to range -1200 to 1200.

#### `playbackRate`
- Default value is 1.0.
- Nominal range is -∞ to ∞.
- For example value of 1.0 plays audio at normal speed, whereas value of 2.0 plays audio twice as fast as normal speed.
- When created with `createBufferSource(true)` it is clamped to range 0 to 3 and uses pitch correction algorithm.
